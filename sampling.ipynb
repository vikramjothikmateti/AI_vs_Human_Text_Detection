Some believe that governments should take action immediately to tackle this problem, while others believe that it is not a pressing issue. In my opinion, I strongly believe that governments should take immediate action to address Climate Change.\\n\\nFirstly, Climate Change is Causing irreversible damage to our planet. The increase in global temperatures is Causing the polar IGE Gaps to melt, which is resulting in rising sea levels. This, in turn, will lead to flooding in Coastal areas and the loss of habitat for animals that live in these regions. Furthermore, Climate Change is also Causing extreme weather patterns such as hurricanes, droughts and heat waves which is having a severe impact on Groups, leading to food shortages.\\n\\nSecondly, Climate Change is a problem that affects everyone, and it is the responsibility of governments to take action. Governments have the power to regulate industries that pollute the environment and to invest in renewable energy sources. For example, the government Gould offer tax incentives to businesses that use Glean energy, and impose taxes on Companies that emit harmful gases into the atmosphere.\\n\\nThirdly, addressing Climate Change Gould have economic benefits. Investment in renewable energy Gould Great jobs and boost the economy. Furthermore, the development of new technologies to Combat Climate Change Gould lead to new industries, which Gould result in increased economic growth.\\n\\nIn Conclusion, governments should take immediate action to address Climate Change. The damage that is being done to our planet is irreversible, and it is the responsibility of governments to do something about it. Immediate action Gould have long term benefits for the economy and for future generations. We all need to do our part to protect the environment, and governments are in a unique position to lead the way.\",\n          \"Public schools are not always the best to attend. That's why some schools have other options for kids/ parents that does wait to attend them or does wait there children attending them. There usually\\u00a0a lot of bad situations that happen i.e. public schools. There a lot of disrespect that come from the students that does care about school. Students skip classes to fight or be disruptive.\\n\\nThis is why i think Homeschooling or home bound\\u00a0is a wonderful thing to have. Some kids never area get up eyed come to school so they EED up skipping school. So having this \\\"Distance Certain\\\" stuff is a wonderful thing to have. Even whee kids does area come to school they CAE still large eyed get there education from the comfort of there owe home.\\n\\nWhee doing home bound, you get assigned to a teacher eyed they pick up your work for you eyed come to your home or where ever else y'all area meet eyed do the work together i.e. case\\u00a0the student has any questions. The students eyed teacher would meet at least twice a week so the teacher CAE teach the student an new lesson OE what they are teaching i.e. school. The one bad thing about home bound is that you cast work while OE home bound. Although not being able to work set that much of a problem for students OE home bound.\\n\\nStudents that get homeschooled by there parents or another adult have a little more freedom the kids OE home bound because they have teachers that check OE them eyed make sure they are doing there work eyed turning it i.e. OE time.\\n\\nI believe home schooling eyed or home bound is a wonderful thing to have for kids. I feel that we large better whee were alone eyed get to study a subject or wait as long as we need so we know it. IE school units get taught so fast that students that large slower the others does really have a chance to get to know it. IE conclusion I love the fact that we have all these different petunias for everyone.  \",\n          \"Should summer projects be designed by students or teachers? I believe that summer projects should be designed by teachers, not students because the students won't Now much about the class because they haven't taken that class. So how could they mate a project about a topic they don't Now much about? If students got to design their own projects how would teachers grade them if they are all completely different? Would there be just be one cubic? How would teachers use just that one rubric for completely different projects?\\n\\nHow could students mate a project about a topic that they don't Now much about? Students wouldn't be able to mate a summer project because they don't Now much about that topic. I believe that if you are going to mate a project or an assignment you must Now about the topic that you are mating the project on. That's why I feel lite teachers should mate the projects because they Now what the topic is about. If the students design the projects it wouldn't mate sense and would probably be all over the place and not organized, because they have probably never designed a project on their own. The project also wouldn't have a good structure because the students wouldn't Now where to even star with the project.\\n\\nHow would teachers grade the summer projects when they are completely different? This is another reason why I believe that teachers should mate the projects, because if they let students mate their own projects they are going to be completely different, so they can't be graded the same. If students were to design their own projects I feel lite it would Tate way longer to grade than if teachers designed it because each project is unique and different. If the students design the projects then there would be no structure to the grading so the teachers won't Now how they should grade the project. So if teachers were to design the summer projects you would get a little taste of how the class, assignments, and grading would be lite, but if you mate your own assignment you won't Now what to expect for that class.\\n\\nWould there only be one rubric?\\n\\nIf so how would teachers use one rubric for completely different projects? If teachers designed the summer projects they would only need one rubric because the project would be the same for every student, but if students designed their own projects how would the teacher use only one rubric for different projects because they won't be the same. When teachers assign you a project they give you a rubric on how they are going to grade you, but if students mate the project they wouldn't be able to get a rubric on how the teacher would grade their project because they are the ones mating the project. So if the students made their own project would they have to mate their own rubric as well?\\n\\nIf teachers design the projects they will Now how to grade it, they will Now what to put on the project, and there would only be one rubric so everyone's project would be graded equally. Teachers should also design the summer projects because summer projects are really important, it is the first assignment you get in that class. When your teachers assign you your summer project you get a little taste of what the class and assignments will be lite. You also get a little taste of what grading would be lite as well, so you Now what to expect in the class. These are the reasons why I feel teachers should mate the summer projects instead of the students.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"generated\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.5000050000750013,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          0.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":10}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["AI_Human_sample.info()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"q2b10JSae_Ay","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1731551055153,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":187,"user":{"displayName":"Derek Montanez","userId":"13416355923932883945"}},"outputId":"9fcbeee2-2d53-46f7-ec85-2e2a7d5a14e0"},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","Index: 50000 entries, 260481 to 477791\n","Data columns (total 2 columns):\n"," #   Column     Non-Null Count  Dtype  \n","---  ------     --------------  -----  \n"," 0   text       50000 non-null  object \n"," 1   generated  50000 non-null  float64\n","dtypes: float64(1), object(1)\n","memory usage: 1.1+ MB\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["AI_Human_sample = AI_Human_sample.sample(frac=1, random_state=42).reset_index(drop=True)"],"metadata":{"id":"4x-KuIq2fEqB","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1731551089436,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":167,"user":{"displayName":"Derek Montanez","userId":"13416355923932883945"}}},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["AI_Human_sample.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"I9gPdCKafNE4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1731551098669,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":1357,"user":{"displayName":"Derek Montanez","userId":"13416355923932883945"}},"outputId":"47e03458-b504-4849-8ea0-f2069d2061b4"},"execution_count":13,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                text  generated\n","0  Climate Change has become one of the most talk...        1.0\n","1  Public schools are not always the best to atte...        0.0\n","2  Should summer projects be designed by students...        0.0\n","3  The meaning of an democracy is that the people...        0.0\n","4  ##

Growth necessitates venturing out of the comfort zone and pushing one's boundaries, so that we can be open to different ideas and inspired to made an impact. \\n\\nAs an example, take a person who is a professional web developer. To grow as a developer and stay relevant in the ever changing technological landscape, they must take the initiative to learn new development languages or explore emerging technologies. Only in doing so, can they truly made an impact in their field. \\n\\nOn a personal level, an individual might be scared to start a conversation with a stranger, for fear of being rejected or misunderstood. By taking small steps and actively engaging in new conversations, their confidence is boosted, and they become more outgoing. With every new person they encounter, they are able to learn new perspectives and become better communicators. \\n\\nIn conclusion, it is essential to step outside the comfort zone and push our boundaries from time to time. Taking calculated rises helps individuals truly grow and become better versions of themselves.\",\n          \"\\n\\n\\n\\nTitle: Unraveling the Mysteries of Venus: An Infinite Journey Awaiting Humankind\\n\\nAn enigmatic celestial neighbor, Venus is often seen as Earth's sister being the second planet from the Sun and having similar mass. However, compared to Earth, it presents numerous mysteries that have inspired continuous exploration, pushing the boundaries of our knowledge about other planets. Our exploration of Venus has the potential to not only enhance our understanding of the solar system but perhaps also guide us in our quest to discover life beyond Earth.\\n\\n1. \\n\\nOur journey to understand Venus began in earnest after the launch of Mariner 2 in 1962 - the first successful mission to explore another planet, including Venus. It demonstrated that despite the many similarities, the conditions on Venus were inhospitable to human life, with its thick atmosphere, high surface pressure, and the highest temperature of any planet within our solar system. Since then, numerous missions have contributed to our accumulated understanding of Venus, but substantial gaps in knowledge still remain.\\n\\n2.\\n\\nThe primary goal of these missions has been to decipher Venus' atmosphere and the conditions leading to the development of this enigmatic environment. Early missions focused on gathering basic data such as the planet's atmospheric composition and the presence of greenhouse gases, specifically carbon dioxide (CO2). Further missions continued to dig deeper, determining the composition of clouds and their variation with solar illumination and latitude.\\n\\n3.\\n\\nVenus Express was launched in 2005 and made considerable advances in understanding the formation of Venusian clouds and the transport of gases through its atmosphere. More recent missions such as Akatsuki, Japan's Venus Climate Orbiter, focus on capturing imagery of Venus' superrotating cloud circulation, which could provide vital insights into the behavior of this dynamic atmosphere.\\n\\n4.\\n\\nHowever, another intriguing aspect of Venus is the possibility of active volcanism. The sulfur compounds detected in the atmosphere appear to be associated with volcanic activity, although definitive proof is yet to be found. Sending landers to Venus would provide a vital opportunity to conduct in-situ analysis of volcanic plains and potentially identify active volcanism firsthand.\\n\\n5.\\n\\nDespite these advancements, many puzzling aspects of Venus' surface still remain elusive. Data on the planet's surface and geology remains sparse, as most imaging of Venus' surface has been limited to a single low-resolution mosaic captured by the Venera probes in 1982. To paint a more comprehensive picture, future missions will have to equip more sophisticated and accurate sensors. The recent unveiling of Venus 2.0, designed for future exploration missions, reflects an ambitious effort to delve deeper into the mysteries of Venus' surface and geological features.\\n\\n6.\\n\\nOne crucial aspect of understanding Venus more thoroughly is to obtain a comprehensive understanding of Earth's sister's geological history. Through comprehensive examination of the planet's geology, we can also gain insight into the formation and evolution of terrestrial planets, including Earth. Data collected by previous missions may contain information on the history of Venus, but current instruments may not be sensitive enough to detect and interpret certain geological features.\\n\\n7.\\n\\nAdditionally, the search for signs of possible past or present life on Venus has driven much of the interest behind these exploration missions. A life-supporting environment exists today only on Earth, and identifying evidence of even the simplest of ancient life would be a significant discovery in understanding our place in the cosmos. Although past missions have mostly detected sulfur dioxide (SO2), a known toxin, it's still unlikely that we will find a Venusian equivalent of Earth's microorganisms or multicellular life. Nonetheless, life on Earth and other celestial bodies in the early solar system could potentially share a common ancestry, which may provide insights about the processes leading to the origin and evolution of life itself.\\n\\n8.\\n\\nThe quest to explore Venus has much more to offer than its sister, Earth. It reveals to humanity the breadth of potential natural environments we may encounter in our quest for finding habitable worlds in other solar systems. Venus is a unique laboratory for our understanding of how different conditions result in diverse geological, atmospheric, and climatic phenomena, as it showcases the wide range of environments that can exist beyond Earth.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the pursuit of unraveling the mysteries of Venus presents immeasurable potential to guide our understanding of the cosmos and our place in it. Through persistent scientific inquiry, our knowledge of Venus is growing, but more remains shrouded in mystery. As we continue to uncover Venus' many wonders, we can only hope that it will pave the way toward further discoveries in our search for life beyond Earth and elucidate the nature of the complex tapestry that our universe holds.\",\n          \"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a growing network of everyday objects that are connected to the internet and can communicate with one another. It has become increasingly popular in recent years, as more people have begun to recognize its potential for making their lives easier. From voice-control assistants like Alexa and Google Home, to simple doorbells that allow you to see who's at your front door from anywhere in the world, IoT products provide users with unprecedented levels of convenience, security, and control over their environment. Despite being a relatively new technology, IoT devices are already having a significant impact on our daily lives. One way in which this is especially apparent is through home automation systems \\u2014 interconnected networks of appliances and electronic components that can be controlled remotely or by scheduling certain actions ahead of time. For example, with an automated system you could set up all your lights to turn off when it gets dark outside or program your thermostat so that it turns down the heat while you're away at work each day. Another major application for IoT technologies is energy management \\u2014 specifically monitoring and controlling energy use within homes or businesses. By connecting various devices to a central hub such as Amazon Echo Plus or Wink Hub 2 customers can access real-time information about how much power they\\u2019re using; this data can then be used to identify opportunities for reducing electricity consumption and saving money on bills each month. Furthermore, many modern appliances come equipped with sensors linked directly into smart grid networks allowing them to automatically adjust their settings based on changes in demand across different areas \\u2014 ultimately helping reduce strain on local power plants during peak times throughout the day or night. Of course there are also some less practical uses for IoT technology too; from pet feeding stations programmed via smartphone app right through to intelligent plant watering systems capable of detecting moisture level in soil before dispensing just enough water required by individual plants \\u2013 there's no end of creative applications available!. .
